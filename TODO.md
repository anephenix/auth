# TODO List

## Now

- [x] Convert the library to TypeScript

## Next

- [ ] Figure out whether to include the build in git or to ignore it and have it as a GitHub workflow step
- [ ] Setup GitHub workflows in case any are missing
- [ ] Setup size-limit to evaluate the build
- [ ] Setup Husky so that it will fail if a pre-commit step fails

## Nice to haves
