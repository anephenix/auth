# TODO List

## Now

- [x] Convert the library to TypeScript
- [x] Figure out whether to include the build in git or to ignore it and have it as a GitHub workflow step
- [x] Setup size-limit to evaluate the build
- [x] Setup GitHub workflows in case any are missing
- [x] Setup Husky so that it will fail if a pre-commit step fails

## Next


## Nice to haves
