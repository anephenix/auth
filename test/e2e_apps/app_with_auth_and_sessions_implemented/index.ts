    I think that this is where the fastify instance is created and the routes 
    are defined.

    As for a running server, we could load that in a server.js file for it to 
    run and listen on a port.

    Whereas in the unit tests we can manually get it to listen and to close 
    the server as part of the setup and teardown of the tests.
